```{r}
#getwd() identifies the working directory associated with this Git Hub project

#file.path() creates a file path name that concatenates the working directory with the sub folder for the data, and also automatically adjusts the direction of slashes for your operating system
dir <- file.path(getwd(),"Point level data")

#Now we append the name of the data set to the directory
out <- read.csv(file.path(dir, "MU-BU-Ghana.csv"))

summary(out)
