### Functions
    * There are 3 parts to a function
        1. Arguments
        2. Body
        3. Environment
    
* Scoping is the process R uses to look up values
* If the name is not defined locally then it looks one environment up, if nothing is defined it will return an error

* There are two types of vectors in R
    1. Atomic
    2. Lists 
    * Every vector has 2 key properties
        1. lengthof(x)
        2. typeof(x)
        
#### When to write a function?
* Once you've copied and pasted twice, it's time to write a function
