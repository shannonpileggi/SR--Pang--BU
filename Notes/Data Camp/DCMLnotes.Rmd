#### Machine Learning
* Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. Construct/use algorithms that learn from data.
* Goal: Building an algorithm to predict the outcome

##### Common Machine Learning Topics
1. Classification
    * Predict category(Qualitative Response) of a new observation 
2. Regression
    * Estimating an actual value and not just category 
3. Clustering 
    * Grouping objects in clusters
        * Similar within each cluster
        * Dissimilar between classes
