#### Machine Learning
* Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. Construct/use algorithms that learn from data.
* Goal: Building an algorithm to predict the outcome

##### Common Machine Learning Topics
1. Classification
    * Predict category(Qualitative Response) of a new observation 
2. Regression
    * Estimating an actual value and not just category 
3. Clustering 
    * Grouping objects in clusters
        * Similar within each cluster
        * Dissimilar between classes
        
#### Supervised Learning
    * Find a function, f, which can be used to assign a class or value to unseen observations
    * Given a set of labeled observations
    
#### Unsupervised Learning
    * Does not require labeled data 
    
#### Semi-Supervised Learning
    * Some of the data is labeled
    * A lot of the data is unlabeled 
    * Use clustering to group together the similar obervations
    * Using clustering information and classes of labeled observations to assign a class to unlabeled observations
    * This gives you more labeled data to perform supervised learning
    
#### Is the model good?
    1. Accuracy
        * Accuracy = # correct / total number
        * Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
        * Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
    2. Computation time
    3. Interpretability
    
    For Clustering:
    * We want the within variability to be low and the between variability to be high.
        * __Within__ 
            * Within sum of squares (WSS)
            * Diameter 
        * __Between__
            * Between sum of squares (BSS)
            * Dunn's Index: minimal intercluster distance / maximal diameter
Supervised learning: Must be able to predict 
    * Unseen Observations
    
How to split your sets?
    * Typically 3:1
    
* n-fold cross-validation
    * Fold test over dataset n times
    * Each test is 1/n size of the total datset
    
Splitting the data into train and test sets
n <- nrow(df)
shuffled_df <- df[sample(n), ]
train_indices <- 1:round(0.7 * n)
train <- shuffled_df[train_indices, ]
test_indices <- (round(0.7 * n) + 1):n
test <- shuffled_df[test_indices, ]
