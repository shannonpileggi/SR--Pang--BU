#### Machine Learning
* Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. Construct/use algorithms that learn from data.
* Goal: Building an algorithm to predict the outcome

##### Common Machine Learning Topics
1. Classification
    * Predict category(Qualitative Response) of a new observation 
2. Regression
    * Estimating an actual value and not just category 
3. Clustering 
    * Grouping objects in clusters
        * Similar within each cluster
        * Dissimilar between classes
        
#### Supervised Learning
    * Find a function, f, which can be used to assign a class or value to unseen observations
    * Given a set of labeled observations
    
#### Unsupervised Learning
    * Does not require labeled data 
    
#### Semi-Supervised Learning
    * Some of the data is labeled
    * A lot of the data is unlabeled 
    * Use clustering to group together the similar obervations
    * Using clustering information and classes of labeled observations to assign a class to unlabeled observations
    * This gives you more labeled data to perform supervised learning
