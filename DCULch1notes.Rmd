### _Unsupervised Learning_
+ Finding patterns in data without making predictions
+ Finding structure in unlabeled data

#### _Goals_
+ Find homogeneous subgroups within a population, called clustering
+ Segmenting a market of consumers
+ Finding movies most like another movie
+ Finding patterns in the features of the data
### _Dimensionality Reduction_

#### _Goal_
+ Visually represent high D data while maintaining much of the data variability
+ Pre-processing step for supervised learning
+ Generally no goal of the analysis
### _Supervised Learning_
+ Making predictions based on labeled data
+ Predictions like regression or classification
+ Labeled vs Unlabeled?
